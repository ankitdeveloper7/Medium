## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- PostgreSQL database
- (Optional) Cloudflare account for deployment

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd Medium
```

### 2. Install dependencies

#### Client

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

#### Server

```bash
cd ../server
npm install
```

### 3. Set up environment variables

- Create a `.env` file in `server/` with your database URL and any other secrets required by Prisma and the backend.

### 4. Run the development servers

#### Client

cd client
npm run dev
```

#### Server

```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

### 5. Build and Deploy

  ```
- To deploy the server (Cloudflare Workers):
  ```bash
  npm run deploy
  ```

## Database Schema

The backend uses Prisma ORM with a PostgreSQL database. The main models are:

```prisma
model User {
  id       Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  name     String
  email    String  @unique
  password String
  blog     Blog[]
}

model Blog {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  authorId  Int
  title     String
  content   String
  imagelink String
  published Boolean  @default(false)
  createdAT DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
  author    User     @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
}
```
